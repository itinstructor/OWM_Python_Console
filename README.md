# OpenWeatherMap Console App

OpenWeatherMap Python Console Program App

## Overview

- Python console program using requests, OpenWeatherMap One Call API, OpenWeatherMap Air Pollution API, and Nominatim from geopy.
- Includes current and forecast weather, UV index, and Air Quality Index.
- Air Quality Index is a separate API call from OpenWeatherMap Air Pollution API.
- The lat and long retrieved from OpenWeatherMap is reverse geocoded into the name of the location using Nominatim from geopy.
  - The reverse geocoding from geopy confirms that we have the weather for the right city.
- JSON sample response files used to build the program are in the json_response_files folder.
